Because when you give respect to your roots, you see the results at harvest time. You take care of your roots by utilizing their ability to form symbiotic relationships with beneficial fungi and bacteria.These relationships help your roots intake nutrients. Beneficial microbes break down old root material, and provide nutrition. On top of that, microbes provide aeration so oxygen can reach further to penetrate more into roots. They also capture nitrogen and help make phosphorus more available, which you are aware of as essential, major nutrients for your plants.. "
