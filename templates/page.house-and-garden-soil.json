You’ll also witness amazing results from the humic acids and powerful non-ionic surfactant, which form a multi-stage delivery matrix to ensure your plants absorb the powerful nutrients you’re feeding them.And if that weren’t enough, you can throw away your pH meters and pens forever. Our proprietary pH Perfect Technology will keep the pH in the ‘sweet spot’ every week of the grow phase, with no measuring or tweaking. And as always, if you’re not thrilled and amazed with your results using pH Perfect Sensi Grow, you get 100% of your money back!"
