One of the most concentrated enzyme products on the market, Multi Zen boosts overall plant immunity by breaking down dead root material and converting it into nutrients the plant can absorb -- but that's just one aspect of its benefits. Breaking down this dead root material prevents bacterial and fungal diseases, keeping your root zone happy and healthy. Other enzymes included in each bottle convert nutrients into more readily available \"chunks\", boosting the rate of nutrient uptake and ensuring you're getting every benefit from the other nutrients you're feeding your plants."

Our Algen extract is extracted in cold water, which ensures the biological life remains intact and un-denatured. The extract is therefore rich in both macro nutrients (such as N, P, K, Ca, Mg &amp; S) and micro nutrients (Mn, Cu, Fe &amp; Zn). Algen Extract also contains very high levels of natural hormones, polysaccharides and proteins.These substances stimulate healthy root growth, which makes Algen Extract an important supplement to the base nutrients of the plant. Algen Extract plays a significant role in the health of your plant’s immune system, providing superior resistance to disease and pests. The Norwegian kelp is very unique and its benefits will be evident within a couple of days. Spoil your plants with Algen Extract and reap the rewards through faster, healthier growth.

            "description": "House &amp; Garden Bud XL has the unique ability to extract sugars from the leaves of the plant and transfer them to the fruit. The fruit is made sweeter and its taste is improved. Bud XL will also increase the size and robustness of the plant’s fruits, which in turn will result in an increase in the final yield. It has been known for a century that enzymes act as a transporter and distributor of sugars in the plant. Bud XL uses these enzymes to extract sugars growing heavier and denser flowering sites. Start adding Bud-XL to the nutrient after the first flowers are formed. This is the period that the big bract loses its function. By adding Bud-XL you ensure that the plant’s energy is no longer used for keeping the bract, but is directed to forming flowers and fruits. This enzyme based booster, redirects stored sugars and carbs to the fruits or flowers using the plants own resources enhancing essential oil production. <br>Dosage: 1ml\/L"
