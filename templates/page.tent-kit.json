Your dense buds will hold moisture creating a ripe place for mold to grow. Not a good thing for your lungs or health of your buds. An exhaust fan can take care of this problem easily.<\/li> \n<li>Smell is often a complaint, nuisance or possibly even a legal issue in some situations. This can be taken care of by combining an exhaust fan and a carbon filter. The filter will remove any smell that might be exhausted into your room, garage or outdoor environment that could unsettle your neighbors.\n<\/li> \n<li>A simple fan to move the air inside your tent will help you plants breath. Stagnant air will become humid in spots if the air in the tent isn’t moved around. A circulation fan and an exhaust fan work together to keep the environment in your grow tent at the optimum humidity level. \n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>Our air and humidity kits are equipped to manage any growing situation inside a grow tent.<\/p>"
