For best results we recommend adding our ‘Air and Humidity kit’ to maximize the potential of your plants.

They do contain quality components that are proven to last a produce those dank buds we all crave. In addition, we provide the support and info you need for a successful grow. Give us a call during business hours for your answers. We have chosen AC Infinity products along side Gro Pros LED lighting because of their superior quality and reasonable price points.<\/p>\n \n<p>Refer below for more information.<\/p>",
        "bottom-of-page": "Problems that can occur\nHere is a list of some problems you may run into: \n•\tHumidity is problematic especially during the flowering stage. Your dense buds will hold moisture creating a ripe place for mold to grow. Not a good thing for your lungs or health of your buds. An exhaust fan can take care of this problem easily. \n•\tSmell is often a complaint, nuisance or possibly even a legal issue in some situations. This can be taken care of by combining an exhaust fan and a carbon filter. The filter will remove any smell that might be exhausted into your room, garage or outdoor environment that could unsettle your neighbors. \n•\tA simple fan to move the air inside your tent will help you plants breath. Stagnant air will become humid in spots if the air in the tent isn’t moved around. A circulation fan and an exhaust fan work together to keep the environment in your grow tent at the optimum humidity level. \nOur air and humidity kits are equipped to manage any growing situation inside a grow tent."
